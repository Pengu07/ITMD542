      <h2>Greetings</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Aleks and this is the root page for my repository for ITMD 542. I took
        ITMD 441 last semester, and am continuing on by taking this class. I am a co-term student, and
        as such this time I am taking this class at a graduate level.
      </p>

      <h2>Srecko</h2>
      <p>
        Also, I would like to introduce my dog Srecko. His name means happy, and he lives up this title
        extremely well. He has spent many hours next to me while studying or working on projects. He is
        a great friend and I hope you like him too.
      </p>
