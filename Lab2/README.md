## Project Description
This assignment was designed to showcase how to use, and the usefulness, of nodejs and express js.

It is also styled using bootstrap.
The project comes with a single user prepopulated to show how it looks to begin with.

## Installation Instructions


## Insights and Results 
I think this assignment did a good job showing me how to utilize Node JS and some of its features better. Along with the efficiency that comes with using express js.
I didnt have any difficulties, and mainly just needed time putting all the pieces together.

## References
I didnt really use any external sources, I learned everything I needed to from watching the lecture recordings or reading official documentation.
