## Insights and Results 
I think this assignment did a good job showing me how to utilize Node JS and some of its features better. Along with the efficiency that comes with using express js.
I didnt have many difficulties, and mainly just needed time putting all the pieces together.

I was able to learn as I went along doing the assignment and watching the lectures.
